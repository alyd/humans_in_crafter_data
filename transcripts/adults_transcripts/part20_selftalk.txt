*(1:24) participant: oh man. oh okay so i find the arrows point to people. oh i see, that’s what the ###. 
*(2:54) participant: okay, that’s fine. yeah cause i sort of had an assumption about the people but that didn’t seem to be working. i thought that if i use the yellow sword on them, they would die and leave me alone.
*(3:11) participant: cause yeah. okay so it’s not working. i need to run away.
*(3:28) participant: game over. okay so
*(4:33) participant: ###
*(4:58) participant: why?
*(5:01) participant: once one of them gets you they just stay with you
*(5:45) participant: oh i see. oh now i know. okay, i think i’m ##
*(6:44) participant: yes! i killed one. game over.
*(6:50) participant: okay so i figured out how to kill them though.
*(6:59) participant: okay. yep, that’s good. survived that one.
*(7:14) participant: oh nice.
*(8:00) participant: so we have the heart. we don’t know - i’m not told what the other symbols are. um, i only know the heart thing. uh, something looks like water, earth, and plant. ## what those are. let’s see if i ##
*(8:54) participant: i don’t know. it’s killed me a number of times and i still haven’t figured out everything that is happening.
*(9:21) participant: i don’t know how to use most of these other things. the only thing i have done is i have planted a crafting table. that works. i wanna make a wooden pickaxe. okay, that’s it.
*(9:47) participant: ##
*(10:03) participant: kay
*(10:12) participant: that does a crafting table. #
*(10:26) participant: oh i see that makes more sense. then you make another one. and now – ohhhh, now i get it! that took a while. i think i’m getting the hang of this better.
*(10:48) participant: yeah for a while i was just wandering around, didn’t understand the rules of the game. but i think i am understanding it better now.
*(11:01) participant: so, i need wood, make a crafting table. and i’m gonna make a crafting table so i can make a sword and then i can fight with it. i make a yellow sword and i can fight with it. it’s game over.
*(11:37) participant: most games tell you what to do, this isn’t saying anything to me. so i’m just wandering around.
*(11:47) participant: kay
*(11:57) participant: ###
*(12:40) participant: ### doesn’t make. okay so you need more than one. need more than one tree to make. does it make? no? yes it does. and you can make uh #. and then you eat, no. can you make – yes you can make one. and then you can fight, you can kill them. no it can’t. okay.
*(13:24) participant: get enough wood.
*(13:30) participant: you start off by getting 9.
*(13:34) participant: okay then you have that. then you can make # and then you make yeah pickaxe as well. um then you can fight
*(14:04) participant: there has to be a way to finish this
*(14:07) participant: okay so starts again, wood. ##
*(14:14) participant: three, four okay. then make a table, with the table make a sword. and make - okay. so have the sword. how do you pick up a specific weapon? oh you’re not.
*(14:38) participant: umm how do you pick up a specific weapon if you have it.
*(14:49) participant: why, it – hold on.
*(15:23) participant: dude stop chasing me around. what is it? kay.
*(15:39) participant: i haven’t been able to do most of the things
*(15:41) participant: wait, okay so if i ##
*(15:59) participant: oh, who would have thought? 
*(16:17) participant: actually not doing most of what i see here
*(16:23) participant: kay
*(16:30) participant: sooo, next thing build the table with your wood. also make the pickaxe.
*(16:48) participant: then get more wood. so, okay
*(16:58) participant: why? why are they so difficult to kill?
*(17:17) participant: yeah because i feel like i have not done a lot of things in the game yet. like i’ve not mined anything yet. um ##
*(17:35) participant: this does give you extra life when you’ve lost some life. yeah okay. ###
*(17:56) participant: doesn’t work.
*(18:03) participant: ohhh, okay that makes better sense. that makes more sense.
*(18:31) participant: trapped.
*(18:39) participant: uhhh this is no good. i’m basically trapped in a corner.
