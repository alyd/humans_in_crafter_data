*(2:33) participant: ahhhh, i’m running into the plants, i can chop things because i have, i can make a, oh okay cool, ahh, i can #.
*(2:46) participant: cow? no, no it’s faster than i am. what is this, ahhh i got you, haha, i have the cow.
*(2:54) participant: oh no what is this, a zombie?
*(2:56) participant: i should run, oh no, oh noooo.
*(3:01) participant: ahh i need to remember where my sword is to be able to survive.
*(3:04) participant: uh, oh no this one, it’s shooting arrows, it’s not, maybe not great.
*(3:14) participant: it’s nighttime, okay maybe not great.
*(3:16) participant: okay, um, how do i get my sword.
*(3:19) participant: i should click start. nope.
*(3:21) participant: uh it’s going after me.
*(3:25) participant: run for your life!  
*(3:29) participant: um maybe i should just figure out what happens when i die.
*(3:30) participant: let’s, die okay.
*(3:31) participant: come on zombie, eat me.
*(3:33) participant: um, game over, alright. i died. cool. let’s try this again.
*(3:37) participant: okay. um, so i have health.
*(3:40) participant: um, when i click on the tree again, that’s red, then i get a wood, that seems good.
*(3:45) participant: i feel like a crafting table might be nice, which i can do, okay that’s blue.
*(3:50) participant: nope can’t do that, so let’s see what i can do.
*(3:52) participant: wait, can i hit this thing?
*(3:53) participant: hiya, hiya, come on zombie haha chachacha, nope, you are faster than i am. ##
*(4:00) participant: hiyaaaaaaaaa. die die hiyaaa. ha got you, hahaha.
*(4:05) participant: nope game over okay. i’m bad at this, let's go again.
*(4:08) participant: okay what can i get other than this.
*(4:10) participant: okay, um, if i go into the water do i die?
*(4:12) participant: nope, but if i chop the water, i can’t chop water.
*(4:14) participant: okay that makes sense. if i chop a stone? nope, no. nope. maybe that’s not a stone after all. let’s see.
*(4:27) participant: ooh this thing seems interesting. chop chop chop. no? ok.
*(4:30) participant: i can’t chop this. probably i need something first. so let's see what happens if i first collect trees.
*(5:26) participant: haha die cow, die die die
*(5:34) participant: okay, let's see if i can make anything now.
*(5:38) participant: how about i want crafting table blue? nope.
*(5:40) participant: oh, whoaaa, i got a crafting table. that's awesome. how do i interact with it?
*(5:44) participant: probably that’s red. pew pew pew. nothing’s working. how do i get cows, i was some leather or something.
*(6:14) participant: game over. all right. so.
*(6:33) participant: oh, so much cool stuff in the world.
*(6:34) participant: maybe i could figure out how to stay alive long enough to make stuff to interact with it.
*(6:39) participant: that would be fun. okay. okay.
*(6:43) participant: crafting table by blue. haha. okay.
*(6:46) participant: now i figure how use the table.
*(6:48) participant: if i go here, lets see, wood pickaxe, no no, zombie, i died again.
*(6:56) participant: it's gonna be okay again.
*(6:58) participant: all right. wooden pickaxe i should be able to figure this one out, right?
*(7:02) participant: that probably involves wood, so i probably need trees.
*(7:08) participant: now i can make a crafting table, okay, that's pretty cool. seems like there's some stuff on the crafting table. ###. let’s see if i get this.
*(7:29) participant: just # the things.
*(7:31) participant: oh, wait. but now i have a sword! i have a sword! i know how to make a sword! and i think the sword.
*(7:35) participant: i don't know. give the sword.
*(7:36) participant: oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*(7:40) participant: okay. all right. needs to be a way to actually interact with things in your inventory, i think.
*(7:42) participant: cause i actually got something, which is pretty cool, except that i immediately died because i didn't know how to use my sword.
*(7:47) participant: all right, let's see. uhhh. crafting table, haha! i got you.
*(7:57) participant: ummm… i don’t how many of these are needed but let's go. red. nope.
*(8:08) participant: nope, nope, nope, nope.
*(8:10) participant: i just need more woods.
*(8:12) participant: oh, no. it's coming again. it’s coming again.
*(8:16) participant: in theory, if i use my wood. there should be a way to get it out of my inventory in the ###, and like, make a thing around me.
*(8:23) participant: oh wait , i could make. i could make, like, a barrier of crafting tables to save me. maybe. ummm. let me just like hide here. at least there's, like, a bottleneck.
*(8:49) participant: ok, this seems fine. oh wait wait wait it's killing you no no no. okay, okay, et’s see.
*(9:04) participant: that's what ###, i amost survived one night. it was almost great.
*(9:08) participant: but i think i have a strategy now. and i think the strategy is like, make a house out of crafting tables and possibly cows.
*(9:24) participant: i don't think i can go through them.
*(9:30) participant: here we go. so long as zombies can't go through water.
*(9:38) participant: ha, ha. alright, so now i only need to defend one side.
*(9:40) participant: and that side is water, so i think i'm fine. of course, i'm also trapped.
*(9:48) participant: so many crafting tables around me. i'm not sure how to escape, but this seems like a minor issue.
*(9:54) participant: and while it's nighttime, i can work on trying to figure out–oh, i’m also out of food.
*(9:59) participant: okay, i can. ok. one, where’s one? it says “one”--oh, ok. how do i –ok. button, button. button, button, button.
*(10:10) participant: haha. zombie doesn't know how to get through a crafting table, can you?
*(10:13) participant: hahaha. umm. all right. this is working well. other than the fact that i have no food and i'm stuck.
*(10:21) participant: oh, i've got a sword! i don't even know how i made a sword. uhh, swords are great other than the fact that i can’t use them because i died of hunger.
*(10:26) participant: okay, that's fine. umm okay!
*(10:29) participant: now i need to get a cow first. haha.
*(10:32) participant: die, cow, die, die, die, die!
*(10:33) participant: nope, that’s wrong button.
*(10:34) participant: oh, i got plants too.
*(10:36) participant: oh, what do you know? this is cool.
*(10:39) participant: ok, umm. or maybe these are seeds. let’s go.
*(10:44) participant: it's almost like the cow doesn't want to be eaten. that’s annoying.
*(10:53) participant: let's go up to trees, trees are easier. trees are safer from zombies.
*(10:58) participant: it's getting dark, so i need to find my my ## place first.
*(11:04) participant: oh, boy. now i take your # water, can i?
*(11:09) participant: but i can use my crafting table as a bridge!
*(11:11) participant: no, i can't. okay. so what do i do?
*(11:14) participant: crafting table, which iiiis blue! down. left. blue. okay.
*(11:27) participant: here, here. blue. okay i’m safe. all right.
*(11:33) participant: alright, the night is over.
*(11:34) participant: umm, i have food, but i can't eat it.
*(11:37) participant: but i can click red.
*(11:39) participant: no, that's not what i want to do.
*(11:41) participant: since that red can never eat.
*(11:43) participant: but seems like there should be some way to click to put things down.
*(11:46) participant: but top right is to plant.
*(11:49) participant: okay, let's move to– ok, not gonna work.
*(11:51) participant: okay. umm. different combinations and maybe just like, different orders multiple times. nope nope nope.
*(12:00) participant: okay. i have a pickaxe. yeeeaaah! which means to me i can make a rock one, but i doubt if i will # again.
*(12:05) participant: okay, that's too bad.
*(12:06) participant: all right, more time. let's just make a lot of wood this time and go.
*(12:10) participant: nothing matters but wood, other than maybe cows.
*(12:14) participant: but i don't know how they catch cows.
*(12:16) participant: i don't know how to eat food.
*(12:18) participant: so maybe i just like should figure out how to eat food because i don't know how to do that yet.
*(12:29) participant: no, no. the next step is to find a place for the night.
*(12:34) participant: ### because you're running faster than i was always.
*(12:36) participant: nope, nope. no. i did not find a good place to have it. i'm in trouble, aren't i?
*(12:51) participant: ha! okay. somewhere like a two year old is doing better. i would be sad, i would be very sad.
*(13:04) participant: okay, i think i could figure out how to eat that would be good.
*(13:10) participant: it says, i can click red to eat, but i keep clicking red on my cow but somehow i’ve never been able to eat a cow.
*(13:14) participant: i'm not sure if i'm just, like, doing this wrong.
*(13:15) participant: okay. umm.
*(13:27) participant: oh, no, it's nighttime again.
*(13:30) participant: what do i do? wait. no i died again, ok. that was unfortunate.
*(13:38) participant: oh, i think i need water, too.
*(13:40) participant: that's annoying.
*(13:46) participant: so many things to pay attention to.
*(13:54) participant: so now i think the first priority should be the crafting table. blue.
*(13:59) participant: okay. umm. but again, ### and i did it too early.
*(14:06) participant: umm, what if i go here?
*(14:07) participant: i know you're, you know, said this like when i played minecraft in the past the only way i was able to succeed is cause like a world reset.
*(14:13) participant: so every time i die, i can like pick up where i left off and yet somehow i can't do this here and i think i'm going to die of hunger before nighttime, again!
*(14:23) participant: no, what do i do?
*(14:24) participant: the only option is to leave and get swarmed by zombies.
*(14:32) participant: i should be able to eat,unless, unless–actually, no,i think i don’t actually need to eat, like consume it, so i just need to collect.
*(14:39) participant: okay. so the new plan of action is. . . oh wait, the zombies don’t disappear when it’s light out?
*(14:46) participant: okay. that's unfortunate. ok, break the crafting table. ok, no, i can't break my crafting table.
*(14:52) participant: okay. okay. okay. so i'm just literally stuck.
*(14:54) participant: okay. i think i'm just dead. okay.
*(15:00) participant: oh, no. the arrow is destroying my crafting table. that’s good, ok.
*(15:05) participant: but they also destroyed me. that's not great.
*(15:07) participant: okay, now, this time, lots of plants, lots of cows and lots of grass.
*(15:14) participant: how do i get grass? feels like occasionally i click on it and i get grass, but i don't always.
*(15:18) participant: i'm not sure if i should just be like a ### or something that's different.
*(15:23) participant: umm. so this is probably more turn to, oh, no skeleton.
*(15:28) participant: why are you out and about in the daytime? aren't you nocturnal?
*(15:30) participant: cow cow cow shoot shoot shoot got you. nope nope nope i got you.
*(15:42) participant: gosh, ok.
*(15:45) participant: okay, it's done.
*(16:02) participant: okay getting better at this.
*(16:04) participant: i now at least get to make time before i die.
*(16:05) participant: that's, that’s fine.
*(16:24) participant: oh i got grass, #
*(16:26) participant: now, i think i'm good enough for a night. as long as i find a place to hide.
*(16:31) participant: so i think my plan is to try to find a place to hide.
*(16:33) participant: but now i think i have enough that i can actually craft something to get out of the place and put myself in.
*(16:48) participant: ### to turn around.okay
*(16:58) participant: moving that direction.
*(17:03) participant: okay, now i can craft.
*(17:04) participant: i need a sword, that’s yellow. huh? and i want a sword.
*(17:11) participant: haha pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew.
*(17:14) participant: and what, i died anyway?
*(17:16) participant: i just need–i’m not even sure if i’m using my sword. i might be, hard to say.
*(17:40) participant: i got food. it’s all you need.
*(17:43) participant: we're going to not die.
*(17:48) participant: ### this is not great.
*(17:52) participant: and i die. okay.
*(17:56 participant: super fun game, lots of fun. 
*(18:01) participant: it’s kind of addicting. it's kind of fun, but entirely incompetent something which involves basic life skills and you should see whether they can do it.
*(18:10) participant: okay### although i don't have any food. where did all the cows go?
*(18:15) participant: maybe cows don't like arrows either.
*(18:17) participant: oh no, there's a cow. but there's also zombie.
*(18:20) participant: oh yayayaya. yayaya. no, shoot zombies!. what? no, not there! they're ganging up on me. okay.
*(18:34) participant: somehow when you eat a cow, you get plants.
*(18:49) participant: kind of funny if the game was just like hardcoded that you die by the end of the night regardless of what you do, because sometimes i feel like i'm doing okay and i die anyway. umm.
*(19:03) participant: okay i’m in a good position.
*(19:05) participant: just need to find a place to hide where i can do the hidey thing.
*(19:25) participant: aha! okay, i locked myself in, umm, and now i can craft a wooden pickaxe. that's a green thing. cool. now i can mine.
*(19:36) participant: nope. i accidentally made another pickaxe.
*(19:40) participant: i can–oh i got stone now! let's craft a stone pickaxe.
*(19:47) participant: that's going to be a start. nope, can't do that ,maybe i need more stone?
*(19:51) participant: also, i need food. there are no food in my cavern.
*(19:57) participant: okay. i died of no food, but i got a thing! hahaha! okay.
*(20:08) participant: so is there a way to place blocks? i haven't figured out that part yet. ###
*(20:22) participant: the only thing i know how to place is crafting tables. so i think it’s like easier if i use those as my blocks.
*(20:27) participant: umm, things are not great.
*(20:40) participant: oh, no, that's a bad sign. i'm out at night because i need to find food.
*(20:45) participant: cows why do you run away from me? not the easiest food to get.
*(20:52) participant: i'm sometimes like a runner for your life during the night.
*(20:55) participant: i feel like i should be conserving energy. but, nope. instead i will fight and die. at least we will die gloriously.
*(21:01) participant: no, i will die very quickly. it's not gloriously. umm.
*(21:15) participant: i think i've managed to survive a night. i’ve survived a night, but i haven’t survived two nights. that’s the next thing to do.
*(21:22) participant: there are zombies during the day, it’s not fair!
*(21:24) participant: but i can get you! if anything, i can get your arrows for myself or something. or i could just die horribly.
*(21:32) participant: no, i didn't even get anything from you? that's not fair.
*(21:43) participant: ### i guess ###.
*(22:03) participant: no, i need food. i need to go food hunting. come on.
*(22:09) participant: i’m gonna die. ###. i can’t eat a zombie, can i? i guess perhaps not. okay. new strategy.
*(22:20) participant: umm, let's go get food. that's, like, the only thing i do. umm.
*(22:38) participant: not sure what the grass looks like. i feel like i sometimes get grass. but i'm not sure where it came from.
*(22:59) participant: i don't even know why i died this time. that was not fair.
*(23:09) participant: oh, probably water!
*(23:11) participant: oh, gosh. so many things to keep in mind. i feel like i've been spoiled in the modern age by people giving me food and water, like it'd be so easy to just forget about these things in the real world.
*(23:31) participant: die die die die die haha die die die. gotcha. um okay.
*(23:38) participant: but now i don’t have food! no! oh, so many things to pay attention to.
*(23:42) participant: and also, it's nighttime, so it's zombies. i can't go hide from zombies when i'm trying to eat food. maybe i should outrun zombies.
*(23:51) participant: nope, i can't outrun zombies.
*(23:54) participant: ok, let's try this again. so now, the first step. get, i need at least, like, ten blocks of wood for my crafter home
*(24:04) participant: i feel like i'm not exploring well, i feel like i'm just, like, trying strategies and then trying to execute them.
*(24:09) participant: what is this?
*(24:10) participant: okay, now i need water.
*(24:15) participant: now i need food.
*(24:20) participant: cow die die die!
*(24:22) participant: let’s get priorities: water, food, shelter, umm, anything else i need in life?
*(24:32) participant: and not be surrounded by enemies. it's always nice. ##
*(24:41) participant: water. one. two. three. four. let’s get food. i feel like i can make a sword quicker. i might be able to hunt cows better. but that takes time. we don’t have time.
*(25:11) participant: i do like how zombies are very dumb. apparently i'm very dumb too, so that doesn't really fix things much. okay.
